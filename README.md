This graphic editor was developed as part of my master's thesis. 
Initially, there is a file with the listing of the program in HPGL. 
This editor allows you to extract coordinates from a file and build graphical images based on these coordinates. 
Then these shapes are displayed in the editor, they can be moved, rotated and rotated. 
Also, the editor has created special "zones" in which images are placed. 
Then, after the program is completed, a file with the matrix of these zones is created, where "1" - the figure is in the zone, "0" - the figure is not in the zone.
